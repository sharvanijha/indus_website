        <p>Indus is UCLA's political South Asian student collective. The mission of INDUS at UCLA is to promote solidarity and political awareness between and among South Asians, other communities of color, and all marginalized people. We aim to curate an atmosphere and legacy of social justice that is grounded in radical empathy and love, and we work to fundamentally affirm and defend the humanity of all people.<br> <br>Indus connects with the UCLA community and beyond through its two flagship events, Deepavali and the Zero Week Mixer, as well as other collaborative and introspective events held throughout the year.</p>
